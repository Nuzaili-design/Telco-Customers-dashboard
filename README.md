# Telco-Customers-dashboard
Telco Churn dataset to turn raw data into a retention strategy.

The Standout Insights:

The Senior Gap: I discovered Seniors are twice as likely to churn (41.7%) compared to younger customers. It’s a huge loyalty gap that needs a specific save-strategy.

The "Leaky Bucket": Using a Decomposition Tree, I traced the biggest revenue losses directly to Month-to-Month contracts and Fiber Optic users.

Data to Action: I built a "Top 50 At-Risk" list so retention teams don't have to guess—they know exactly which high-value accounts to call today.
